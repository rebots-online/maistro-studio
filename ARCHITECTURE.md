# mAIstro Studio Architecture

This document provides an architectural overview of the mAIstro Studio application, which is based on a fork of MuseScore, a mature desktop music notation application.

## System Overview

mAIstro Studio is a C++/Qt-based desktop application for music notation and composition. The application leverages the core functionality of MuseScore while planning to extend it with AI-enhanced capabilities.

## Key Components

### Core Components

1. **Music Notation Engine**
   - Located in `src/engraving/`
   - Handles the fundamental music notation logic and rendering
   - Core abstractions for musical elements (notes, staves, etc.)

2. **Application Shell**
   - Located in `src/app/` and `src/appshell/`
   - Manages the application lifecycle and main window
   - Handles platform integration and command-line options

3. **UI Framework**
   - Based on Qt framework
   - Organized in module-specific components (palette, inspector, etc.)
   - Views and models separating presentation from data

4. **Playback System**
   - Located in `src/playback/`
   - Manages audio synthesis and MIDI processing
   - Integrates with various audio backends

### Supporting Components

1. **Import/Export Modules**
   - Located in `src/importexport/`
   - Handles file format conversion (MusicXML, MIDI, etc.)
   - Manages score data serialization

2. **Project Management**
   - Located in `src/project/`
   - Handles score collections and workspace management
   - Manages user preferences and settings

3. **Plugin System**
   - Extensibility mechanism for adding functionality
   - Scripting interface for user extensions

## Build System

The project uses CMake as its build system with the following key aspects:

1. **Build Configuration**
   - Main configuration in `CMakeLists.txt`
   - Uses modular approach with components enabled/disabled via options
   - Platform-specific configuration in `buildscripts/` directory

2. **Dependencies**
   - Qt 6.2.4+ as the primary UI framework
   - Various audio libraries for sound generation
   - Platform-specific dependencies managed through CMake

3. **Build Targets**
   - Multiple build configurations (app, app-portable, vtest, utest)
   - Build modes (dev, testing, release)
   - Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux/BSD)

## Branding Integration Points

The following architectural elements are particularly relevant to the rebranding effort:

1. **Application Identity**
   - Project name and namespaces in CMake configuration
   - Application metadata in platform-specific packaging

2. **Visual Assets**
   - Icons and logos in `share/icons/`
   - UI theme elements and splash screens

3. **Documentation**
   - User manual and help references
   - API documentation and developer guides

4. **Online Services Integration**
   - Score sharing service references
   - Update check mechanisms
   - Community links and resources

## Notes for Future Enhancements

When planning AI-related enhancements for future phases, consider:

1. **Integration Architecture**
   - Create new AI-specific modules in the `src/` directory
   - Consider a plugin-based approach for initial prototyping
   - Ensure clear separation of concerns between notation engine and AI components

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Local vs. cloud-based AI processing
   - Resource management for computationally intensive operations
   - Threading and asynchronous processing for UI responsiveness

3. **API Extensions**
   - Develop clean interfaces for AI components to interact with notation engine
   - Maintain backward compatibility with existing score formats
   - Design for extensibility as AI capabilities evolve

## Conclusion

The existing MuseScore architecture provides a solid foundation for the mAIstro Studio application. Phase I will focus on rebranding while preserving the core functionality, with future phases introducing the AI-enhanced capabilities that will differentiate the application in the marketplace.
