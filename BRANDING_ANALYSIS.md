## Proposed Consistent Brand Assets

To create a cohesive brand identity for "mAIstro Studio," we recommend the following assets:

1. **Logo & Icons**:
   - Primary logo: A stylized "mAIstro Studio" with emphasis on "AI" (perhaps in a different color)
   - Application icon: Music notation symbol with AI-themed visual elements
   - File icons: Distinct but related designs for different file types (.mscz, .mscx)
   - Color scheme: Consider a modern palette that differentiates from MuseScore while emphasizing AI aspects

2. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Application name: "mAIstro Studio"
   - File association prefix: "maistro" (for consistent MIME types)
   - Package/build name: "maistro-studio" (for file paths and URLs)
   - Developer entity: The copyright holder name to replace "MuseScore Limited"

3. **Description/Tagline**:
   - "AI-enhanced music notation and composition studio"
   - Focus on the AI capabilities that distinguish it from standard notation software

4. **Online Integration**:
   - Domain need: maistrostudio.com or similar for online services
   - GitHub repository: Consistent naming with application
   - Documentation site: Branded support portal to replace musescore.org references

5. **Theme Elements**:
   - Consider a distinctive UI color theme that highlights the AI-enhanced features
   - Custom splash screen highlighting the mAIstro brand

This rebranding would create a distinct identity while preserving the powerful functionality of the underlying MuseScore engine. The emphasis on AI in both the name and visual identity would position the application appropriately for its intended purpose.
